					<h1>Extent of Salt Marshes in the UK</h1>
					<p>There have been few historic, comprehensive surveys of salt marsh extent in the UK. In 2006-2009 the Environment Agency conducted a comprehensive survey, utilising aerial photography and ground-truthing, and came to the conclusion that there are around 40,500 ha of salt marsh in England and Wales. The region with the largest area is Anglia with 15,200 ha, closely followed by the North West with 12,000 ha. Separate surveys for Scotland and Ireland each reported in the region of 5,200 ha.</p>

					<h1>Formation</h1>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./images/formation.jpg" class="full">
					<h2>Beginnings</h2>
					<p>Salt marshes form in low energy environments where there is shelter from wind and waves, and a large input of sediment from the sea or rivers. Water movement is slowed down in the sheltered environment and more sediment is deposited. As the elevation of the accreted sediment increases, the duration of tidal flooding decreases, allowing vegetation to form on the periodically exposed flats.</p>

				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./images/stabilisation.jpg" class="full">
					<h2>Stabilisation</h2>
					<p>The long blades of salt marsh grasses such as <em>Spartina</em> and <em>Salicornia</em> trap finer-grained sediments than would freely settle out of water, and their roots stabilise this into a muddy substrate. This causes the surface level of the sediment to rise more rapidly, further decreasing the duration of tidal flooding, allowing further species of plant and animals to colonise the salt marsh.</p>

				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./images/Parkgate.jpg" class="full">
					<h2>Spreading</h2>
					<p>Some salt marsh species such as <em>Spartina</em> are extremely invasive and salt marshes can grow rapidly once they are stable. This can cause problems for coastal communities, who find their livelihood destroyed by the encroachment of the marshes. Parkgate on the Wirral is a good example of this- in the 18th Century it was a major port serving the city of Chester, and as an embarkation point for ships heading to Ireland.  Parkgate was superseded by Liverpool, as the Dee estuary silted up. This was exacerbated in the 1920s by the deliberate introduction of <em>Spartina</em> elsewhere to accelerate land reclamation, and Parkgate is now cut off from the sea by 100 square kilometres of marsh.</p>

				<section data-background-image="./images/die-off.jpg" class="full">
					<h2>Dieback</h2>
					<p>Dieback or browning is the primary source of salt marsh degradation. The plants in the marsh die off, leaving dead organic matter and eventually open sediment. Without the stabilisation from the plant roots, these open areas erode, causing the salt marsh to retreat. Dieback has many potential causes, such as water-logging of the higher marshes, increased sediment, oxygen deficiency, and increased soil salinity.</p>

					<h1>Ecology</h1>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Plants</h2>
					<p>The characteristic vegetation comprises a limited number of salt-tolerant species that are adapted to regular immersion by the tides. Salt marshes exhibit zonation according to the frequency of inundation- the lowest level species such as glassworts (<em>Salicornia</em> spp.) can withstand immersion with every tide, whereas species of the upper marsh may only tolerate occasional inundations</p>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./images/zonation.jpg" class="full">
					<p>Zonation of salt marshes can also be seen in the diversity of plant species, with the low to mid marsh being dominated by a smaller number of species than the mid to upper marsh. Diversity is also affected by climate and sediment particle size, with considerable differentiation between east and west coast marshes, and north and south. In general salt marshes can be split into the following zones or communities:</p>
					<ul>
					<li>Pioneer Marsh: discrete communities of extremely salt-tolerant plants with large amounts of open mudflats</li>
					<li>Lower Marsh: full coverage of marsh, dominated by a few (sometimes single) key salt-tolerant species</li>
					<li>Upper Marsh: more diversity, with less tolerant species being present</li>
					<li>Transitional Marsh: extremely diverse, with species that cannot survive more than occasional inundation</li>

					<h2>Invertebrates</h2>
					<p>The density and diversity of invertebrate species within salt marshes shows significant zonation. In the lowest part of the marshes, microscopic species dominate, with few macroscopic and larger species present. Progressing up through the marsh, while microscopic species are still present in large numbers, they no longer dominate. This zonation is due to multiple factors, from the sediment structure, and micro-climate, to changes in predation pressure. Towards the upper reaches of the marshes, terrestrial invertebrates tend to dominate.</p>

They inhabit U or J-shaped permanent burrows in muddy substrata, and come out to feed during high water. They don't actually leave their burrows, but the disturbance that they cause as they feed potentially causes erosion and prevents sediment from settling, inhibiting salt marsh growth.</p>

They are widely distributed around the British coastline. They can tolerate long exposures out of water, and feed on diatoms and plant litter. Historically misidentified as several different subspecies due to variation in shell shape and colour, this variance is now thought to be a response to predation and wave exposure. </p>

It can reach densities of 100,000 per m<sup>2</sup> in some estuarine areas. It's an important food source for wading birds, and also fish such as flounder (<em>Platichthys flesus</em>). Despite being poor swimmers, they have been observed to swim en masse at night and around spring tides. This is thought to be a method of dispersal to prevent inbreeding, or a response to diminishing food supplies.</p>

					<h1>Human Uses</h1>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./images/seahenge.jpg" class="full">
					<p>Humans have been exploiting salt marshes for millennia, but initially this took the form of subsistence fishing and shellfish gathering. There is some evidence across Europe and the South of England that this progressed to permanent human occupation from around 600BC, with dwellings built on artificial mounds, and livestock grazing (protected by dikes). Large-scale construction of sea walls, to allow more permanent grazing and more permanent arable farming started around the 11th century. In the UK, the timber circle "Seahenge", at Hunstanton in Norfolk, was built in the 21st Century BC, originally on a salt marsh, but it's original use is unknown. Aerial photography also shows that many existing areas of un-ploughed salt marsh show evidence of past human exploitation, such as canalization of creeks, and the construction of trackways and embankments.</p>
					<small class="attribution">https://seahenge.wordpress.com/</small>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Salt Making</h2>
					<p>The use of salt marshes for the production of salt is known from the Bronze Age. The evidence for this is mainly in the South, where it takes the form of "Red Hills", or mounds of burnt clay and plant remains. These are scorched from the fires used to evaporate the sea water to make salt cakes.</p>
					<img class="center" src="./images/Salt-making.jpg">
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./images/cows.jpg" class="full">
					<h2>Grazing</h2>
					<p>Grazing livestock is the primary activity that humans have undertaken on salt marshes, and there is scientific evidence for this as far back as the bronze age. Halophytic or salt-tolerant plants contain significantly higher levels of the nitrogen isotope <sub>15</sub>N than usual, and these enhanced levels are also present in the the skeletal remains of herbivores found in middle and late Bronze Age sites in the Severn Estuary.</p>

					<h1>The value of salt marshes</h1>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Salt marshes add significant value to their local habitat. As well as forming a buffer against storms and flooding, they also improve water quality by nutrient cycling and sediment retention. Scavenging and micro-organism processes decompose and dispose of waste material. Finally they provide key habitats for commercially exploited plants and animals.</p>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./images/waves.jpg" class="full">
					<h2>Flood Defence</h2>
					<p>Salt marshes act to diffuse or attenuate wave energy, reducing wave heights, in comparison to unvegetated tidal flats. Marshes on the seaward side of man-made defences decrease the risk of overtopping and structural undermining, reducing maintenance and repair costs. In many areas "man-made" salt marshes are being created to assist with flood defence, by breaching old walls. Unfortunately studies have shown that these "artificial" marshes have lower biodiversity than naturally occurring marshes, with considerably lower oxygen content in the sediment, and generally lower water content.</p>
					<small class="attribution">http://oceanwealth.org/ecosystem-services/coastal-protection/</small>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Water Quality</h2>
					<p>Salt marshes can act as a sink for various polluting compounds such as herbicides, pesticides and heavy metals. These are adsorbed onto sediment particles and buried, effectively inactivating them, removing them from the food cycle and preventing bioaccumulation, such as in shellfish stocks. However shifts in dynamic processes may cause erosion, releasing the pollutants back into the system. Salt marshes also cycle nutrients such as Nitrogen and Phosphorous.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Carbon Storage</h2>
					<p>Recent studies have shown that healthy coastal and tidal marshes are extremely good at drawing Carbon Dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it for potentially thousands of years. Unlike terrestrial systems, more carbon in coastal marshes is sequestered in the soil, where it can stay for millennia, and woody biomass while less is released back into the atmosphere by respiration. Coastal marshes also accumulate carbon from adjacent ecosystems through vegetation and sediment transport. While this means that they have an important role in climate change mitigation, it also means that threats to the marshes also run the risk of releasing these Carbon Dioxide stores into the atmosphere.</p>

				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Threats and Management</h1>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./images/erosion.jpg" class="full">
					<p>Salt marshes are generally fairly robust and self-sustaining, but are vulnerable to factors that change extents, elevation, water channel morphology, species composition and vegetation healthiness. These factors include land claim and coastal squeeze, over grazing, dredging and navigation, vegetation extraction (cutting turf and reeds, hay making, samphire gathering) and the introduction of invasive species.</p>
					<small class="attribution">Gillian Moy CC BY-SA-2.0 http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/372993</small>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./images/monitoring.jpg" class="full">
					<p>Currently healthy salt marshes don't require much in the way of management, but do require routine monitoring to spot signs of deterioration. The earlier the intervention, the lower the cost of maintenance and the greater the chance of re-establishing the healthy marsh. The three main management techniques are to maintain or restore biodiversity by grazing management, vegetation planting, and pollution control; to manage erosion or accretion by vegetation planting or engineering options; and the creation of new salt marsh habitat (usually to the landward side) by managed realignment.</p>

				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./images/rawhide.jpg" class="full">
					<p>Over grazing is currently considered to be the biggest influence on salt marshes in the UK. Over grazing causes a loss of structural integrity of the marsh, and of plant biodiversity. This in turn changes the ecosystem of the marsh, putting pressure on invertebrate species, and breeding bird populations. Most management techniques involve continued grazing, since disturbed marshes don't tend to maintain their previous state, but do stabilise with grazing-tolerant species. Differing grazing regimes can be used, however, to maintain specific species assemblages. Differing grazing regimes involve different types, densities and sizes of livestock, and allow for different grazing periods throughout the year.</p>

					<h2>Summary</h2>
					<p>Salt marshes have a complex and varied ecosystem, supporting many different organisms, from amphipods to cows. They are an important coastal habitat, in terms of biodiversity, flood defence, water quality and climate change mitigation. While they are relatively robust and self-sustaining, they are at risk from invasive species, over grazing, and poor management decisions. You can help manage our salt marshes by downloading an app (yes really) from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.saltmarshapp.com/the-app/">saltmarshapp.com</a> and contributing to plant and soil surveys about your local salt marsh.</p>
