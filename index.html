					<h1>Extent of Salt Marshes in the UK</h1>
					<p>There have been few historic, comprehensive surveys of salt marsh extent in the UK. In 2006-2009 the Environment Agency conducted a comprehensive survey, utilising aerial photography and ground-truthing, and came to the conclusion that there are around 40,500 ha of salt marsh in England and Wales. The region with the largest area is Anglia with 15,200 ha, closely followed by the North West with 12,000 ha. Separate surveys for Scotland and Ireland each reported in the region of 5,200 ha.</p>

					<h1>Formation</h1>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./images/formation.jpg" class="full">
					<h2>Beginnings</h2>
					<p>Salt marshes form in low energy environments where there is shelter from wind and waves, and a large input of sediment from the sea or rivers. Water movement is slowed down in the sheltered environment and more sediment is deposited. As the elevation of the accreted sediment increases, the duration of tidal flooding decreases, allowing vegetation to form on the periodically exposed flats.</p>

				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./images/stabilisation.jpg" class="full">
					<h2>Stabilisation</h2>
					<p>The long blades of salt marsh grasses such as <em>Spartina</em> and <em>Salicornia</em> trap finer-grained sediments than would freely settle out of water, and their roots stabilise this into a muddy substrate. This causes the surface level of the sediment to rise more rapidly, further decreasing the duration of tidal flooding, allowing further species of plant and animals to colonise the salt marsh.</p>

				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./images/Parkgate.jpg" class="full">
					<h2>Spreading</h2>
					<p>Some salt marsh species such as <em>Spartina</em> are extremely invasive and salt marshes can grow rapidly once they are stable. This can cause problems for coastal communities, who find their livelihood destroyed by the encroachment of the marshes. Parkgate on the Wirral is a good example of this- in the 18th Century it was a major port serving the city of Chester, and as an embarkation point for ships heading to Ireland.  Parkgate was superceded by Liverpool, as the Dee estuary silted up. This was exacerbated in the 1920s by the deliberate introdction of <em>Spartina</em> elsewhere to accelerate land reclamation, and Parkgate is now cut off from the sea by 100 square kilometres of marsh.</p>

				<section data-background-image="./images/die-off.jpg" class="full">
					<h2>Dieback</h2>
					<p>Dieback or browning is the primary source of salt marsh degradation. The plants in the marsh die off, leaving dead organic matter and eventually open sediment. Without the stabilisation from the plant roots, these open areas erode, causing the salt marsh to retreat. Dieback has many potential causes, such as waterlogging of the higher marshes, increased sediment, oxygen deficiency, and increased soil salinity.</p>

					<h1>Ecology</h1>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Plants</h2>
					<p>The characteristic vegetation comprises a limited number of salt-tolerant species that are adapted to regular immersion by the tides. Salt marshes exhibit zonation according to the frequency of inundation- the lowest level species such as glassworts (<em>Salicornia</em> spp.) can withstand immersion with every tide, whereas species of the upper marsh may only tolerate occasional inundations</p>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./images/zonation.jpg" class="full">
					<p>Zonation of salt marshes can also be seen in the diversity of plant species, with the low to mid marsh being dominated by a smaller number of species than the mid to upper marsh. Diversity is also affected by climate and sediment particle size, with considerable differentiation between east and west coast marshes, and north and south.</p>

					<h2>Key Plant Species (not exhaustive)</h2>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./images/Spartina_anglica.jpg" class="full">
					<h2><em>Spartina (spp)</em></h2>
					<p>A pioneer genus, essential to the initial establishment of salt marshes. The native species is <em>Spartina maritima</em>, whereas <em>Spartina anglica</em> is an invasive species descended from <em>Spartina alterniflora</em>, that was accidentally introduced in the 1820s in the ballast of ships from the USA. Cordgrass swards are widely distributed, though <em>Spartina Anglica</em> is less common in Scotland and Ireland. It was extensively planted in the past to aid the stabilisation of mudflats prior to enclosure and land-claims.</p>

				<section data-background-image="./images/salicornia.JPG" class="full">
					<h2><em>Salicornia (spp)</em></h2>
					<p>Another key pioneer genus of intertidal mud and sand flats. Otherwise known as Glasswort or Pickleweed, the main European species are also picked and eaten, we know them better as Samphire or Sea Beans. <em>Salicornia</em> are annual, generally small, and can tolerate total immersion in salt water. They are widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere from subtropic to subarctic regions. Across the UK they are widespread throughout England and Wales but rare in Scotland and Ireland.</p>

					<h2 style="margin-top:100px !important">Waders</h2>
					<p>Salt marshes are an important feeding resource and breeding ground for wading birds. Key species are <em>Gallinago gallinago</em> (Snipe), <em>Tringa totanus</em>, (Redshank), <em>Vanellus vanellus</em>, (Lapwing), and <em>Numenius arquata</em>, (Curlew), all of which are species whose populations have severely declined recently. They all eat earthworms, small crustaceans, and insect larvae that are found within the mud of the marshes.</p>

					<h2>Wintering Species</h2>
					<p>Salt marshes are often used as feeding grounds for large flocks of wild birds such as ducks and geese, particularly over the autumn and winter months. UK salt marshes support internationally significant populations of wildfowl such as Bewick's and Whooper Swans. Locally <em>Anas penelope</em> (Wigeon), <em>Anser brachyrhynchus</em> (Pink-footed goose) and <em>Cygnus cygnus</em> (Whooper Swan) are found on the grazed salt marshes.</p>

					<h2>Fish and Invertebrates</h2>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./images/oyster_beds.jpg" class="full">
					<h2>Fish</h2>
					<p>Salt marshes are believed to act as nursery habitats for juvenile fish from several species, and also as spawning grounds. They provide an influx of organic matter and nutrients to adjacent marine habitats, so increase the productivity of those areas as feeding grounds. Comercially important stocks of shell-fish can also be found on salt marshes, occasionally farmed as well as naturally occurring.</p>

				<section data-background-image="./images/oyster_beds.jpg" class="full">
					<h2>Invertebrates</h2>
					<p>The density and diversity of invertebrate species within salt marshes shows significant zonation. In the lowest part of the marshes, mircoscopic species dominate, with few macroscopic and larger species present. Progressing up through the marsh, while microscopic species are still present in large numbers, they no longer dominate. This zonation is due to mutliple factors, from the sediment structure, and micro-climate, to changes in predation pressure. Towards the upper reaches of the marshes, terrestrial invertebrates tend to dominate.</p>

					<h2>Key Invertebrate Species (extremely non exhaustive)</h2>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./images/ragworm.JPG" class="full">
					<h2><em>Nereis diversicolor</em> (Ragworm)</h2>
					<p>This is an extremely common polychaete in the estuarine intertidal zone. They are widespread around all British Coasts and are a food source for many wading birds but are considered potentially harmful to salt marshes. They inhabit U or J-shaped permanent burrows in muddy substrata, and come out to feed during high water. They don't actually leave their burrows, but the disturbance that they cause as they feed potentially causes erosion and prevents sediment from settling, inhibiting salt marsh growth.</p>

				<section data-background-image="./images/shore_crab.JPG" class="full">
					<h2><em>Carcinus maenas</em> (Shore Crab)</h2>
					<p>Shore crabs are common in the lower part of the salt marsh, where they benefit from cover provided by the vegetation. Crabs that primarily inhabit salt marshes tend to develop a greenish tinge to their carapace, possibly relating to a greater tolerance for salinity and temperature change, Shore crabs build tunnels in the sediment under the vegetation, and again there is some evidence to suggest this might cause destabilisation and erosion of salt marsh banks.</p>

				<section data-background-image="./images/Littorina.jpg" class="full">
					<h2><em>Littorina saxatilis</em> (Rough Periwinkle)</h2>
					<p>Rough periwinkles frequently live in the lower salt marshes, commonly found on the basal stems of <em>Spartina</em> and on firm mud banks, but also occur submerged in brackish lagoons attached to seagrass species. They are widely distributed around the British coastline. They can tolerate long exposures out of water, and feed on diatoms and plant litter. Historically misidentified as several different subspecies due to variation in shell shape and colour, this variance is now thought to be a response to predation and wave exposure. </p>

				<section data-background-image="./images/corophium.JPG" class="full">
					<h2><em>Corophium volutator</em></h2>
					<p><em>Corophium volutator</em> is a burrowing amphipod that is often the most abundant species in the mid to upper marsh area, especially where vegetation is less dominant. It can reach densities of 100,000 per m<sup>2</sup> in some estuarine areas. It's an important food source for wading birds, and also fish such as flounder (<em>Platichthys flesus</em>). Despite being poor swimmers, they have been observed to swim en masse at night and around spring tides. This is thought to be a method of dispersal to prevent inbreeding, or a response to diminishing food supplies.</p>

				<section data-background-image="./images/pardosa_purbeckensis.jpg" class="full">
					<h2><em>Pardosa purbeckensis</em> (Saltmarsh Wolf Spider)</h2>
					<p><em>Pardosa purbeckensis</em> can be found in salt marshes and tidal habitats on mudflats. It runs rapidly over the mud and feeds on beetles, bugs, and small crustaceans.

					<h2>Human Uses</h2>
					<p>Humans have been exploiting salt marshes for millennia but initially this took the form of subsistence fishing and shellfish gathering. There is some evidence across Europe that this progessed to permanent human occupation from around 600BC, with dwellings built on artificial mounds, livestock grazing, and eventual arable use (protected by dikes). Large-scale construction of sea walls, to allow more permanent grazing and year-round arable use started around the 11th century.</p>
